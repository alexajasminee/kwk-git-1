    <h2>When I Joined KWK and My Coding Journey Since Then</h2>
    <p>I joined KWK back in 2020 and 2021 as a web development and mobile app scholar. 
        As a virtual scholar, I felt connected with my fellow scholars and supported by my instructional
        team despite never meeting anyone in person. I was motivated by my talented community of scholars
        to delve into my new coding superpowers to create final projects that would positively benefit everyone.
        After highschool, I continued my STEM studies through my major as I leaned towards learning more about 
        UX and product design, while also enrolling in a few coding and data science courses to expand my technical 
        knowledge.
